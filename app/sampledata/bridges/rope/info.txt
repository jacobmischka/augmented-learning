ROPE BRIDGE
by Ufuk Orbey (shadedancer619)
Made in: Cinema 4 D R16
--------------------------------------
Cinema 4D spline dynamics are used in this project. No connectors, only splines.

91 objects (all structure)
21300 polygons
42112 edges
22937 points

This model is not a heavy one but especialy spline textures increases the file size. For Cinema 4D beginners, there is some fun inside. You may learn a lot about spline constraints and dynamics.

Textures are ok for C4D format but baked textures are perfectly fit to all other formats.
Just find and define them to the correct objects.

See you...
